🌐 **Live Demo:** [Open the Streamlit App](https://nb-analisisentimen-skripsi.streamlit.app/)

This repository contains the source code, trained models, and supporting resources developed as part of an undergraduate thesis on **ordinal rating classification (1–5 stars)** of Indonesian e-commerce reviews using Multinomial Naive Bayes. The proposed framework addresses severe class imbalance through SMOTE resampling and incorporates comprehensive NLP preprocessing, n-gram feature extraction, and hyperparameter optimization.

## 🌐 Web Application

The project includes an interactive Streamlit web application for predicting **ordinal ratings (1–5 stars)** from Indonesian e-commerce reviews.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Comprehensive Text Preprocessing:** Includes noise removal, text cleaning, case folding, tokenization, stopword removal, Indonesian stemming using the `Sastrawi` library, and slang normalization via a Custom Hybrid Dictionary (1,320 entry corpus).

- **Automated N-Gram Evaluation:** An automated evaluation to determine the most predictive feature range (Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram combinations).

- **Strict CV + SMOTE Data Isolation:** Class imbalance is handled using SMOTE inside an `ImbPipeline` to completely prevent data leakage during validation.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematic optimization of Laplace/Lidstone smoothing (`α`) and prior fitting using `GridSearchCV` with Stratified 10-Fold Cross Validation.

## 📚 Data Sources

This project is built upon publicly available datasets and linguistic resources.

### Tokopedia Product Reviews Dataset

- Source: Farhan
- Original dataset containing **40,607** Indonesian product reviews collected from Tokopedia.
- This research uses a cleaned subset consisting of **37,146 unique reviews** after preprocessing and duplicate removal.
- Dataset: [Tokopedia Product Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farhan999/tokopedia-product-reviews)

### Indonesian Slang Dictionary

- Source: sodolanangbjkatio
- Original public slang dictionary used as the baseline resource.
- Extended with a manually curated custom dictionary to create the Hybrid Slang Dictionary used throughout this study.
- Dataset: [Indonesian Slang Dictionary](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sodolanangbjkatio/slang-indonesia)

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage Guide

This project was developed using **Python 3.11**. The examples below use **Miniconda** for environment management, but any isolated Python environment (e.g., `venv` or `uv`) can be used.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erlangga-g/NB_AnalisiSentimen.git
cd NB_AnalisiSentimen
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Miniconda Environment

```bash
conda create -n Skripsi-NaiveBayes python=3.11
conda activate Skripsi-NaiveBayes
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open:

```text
notebooks/NB_SentimentAnalysis_Skripsi_2.ipynb
```

Run the notebook sequentially from the first cell to reproduce the complete experimental pipeline.

> **Note**
>
> Ensure that the dataset and supporting dictionary files remain in their original locations inside the `data/` directory. The notebook uses relative paths to load these resources.
